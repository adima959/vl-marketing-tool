# Campaign Launch System — Product Owner Playbook

> **This document is the operating system for launching new marketing campaigns.** Every product owner fills this in before a single ad is created. The goal: winning ads are built in this document, not in the ad account. Below is the system explained step by step, with FlexRepair (Norway) as the worked example.

---

## HOW THIS SYSTEM WORKS

The system has **5 phases**, each feeding the next:

```
PHASE 1: Product Foundation → PHASE 2: Research → PHASE 3: Strategy Map → PHASE 4: Production Plan → PHASE 5: Launch & Learn
```

You cannot skip phases. Each phase has specific data fields to fill in, and each field exists for a reason explained below. Phase 1 and 2 are where you *think*. Phase 3 is where you *decide*. Phase 4 and 5 are where you *execute and measure*.

---

---

## PHASE 1: PRODUCT FOUNDATION

**Purpose:** Establish the raw material that every persona, angle, and hook will be built from. This is done once per product and updated when the product changes (new formula, new claims, new pricing).

**Why this phase exists:** Most product owners jump straight to "what ads should we run." But if you don't crystallize what makes the product *actually different*, every angle you write will be generic. This phase forces you to articulate the product truth before you start selling.

---

### 1.1 — Product Identity

| Field | FlexRepair Example | Why This Matters |
|---|---|---|
| **Product name** | FlexRepair | Obvious, but needed for system organization when managing multiple products. |
| **One-line description** | Joint & mobility supplement for adults experiencing stiffness, pain, or reduced flexibility. | Forces you to articulate what this product IS in plain language. If you can't say it in one sentence, your ads will be confused too. |
| **Primary market(s)** | Norway (primary), Sweden, Denmark | Different markets need different language, compliance rules, and cultural references. A hook that works in Norway may fall flat in Sweden. Recording this ensures you plan geo-specific creative from day one. |
| **Price point & offer structure** | 599 NOK / 1-month supply. Subscription available at 499 NOK/mo. | Price dictates awareness-level strategy. A 599 NOK product requires more trust-building than a 199 NOK impulse buy. The subscription offer also opens up "risk-free trial" angles you can't use without it. |
| **Key active ingredients / mechanism** | UC-II collagen, Boswellia extract, Vitamin D3, Magnesium. Works by reducing joint inflammation and supporting cartilage regeneration. | This is your *product truth* — the factual backbone of every claim you'll make. Without documenting this, copywriters default to vague benefit language ("feel better!") instead of specific mechanism-based hooks ("UC-II collagen rebuilds the cartilage cushion between your joints"). Specificity sells. |
| **Regulatory constraints** | Cannot claim to "cure" arthritis. Must use "contribute to" language per Norwegian/EU supplement regulations. No before/after medical claims. | Recording this upfront prevents wasted creative production. Nothing kills momentum like producing 20 ads and having compliance reject 15 of them. |

---

### 1.2 — Competitive Positioning

| Field | FlexRepair Example | Why This Matters |
|---|---|---|
| **Top 3 direct competitors** | 1) Collagen+ (Vitaepro line) 2) Moveit (Orkla) 3) Generic glucosamine products at Apotek1 | You need to know WHO you're being compared to in the customer's mind. Your angles will either position against these competitors or ignore them — but that should be a conscious choice, not an accident. |
| **Their main messaging angles** | Vitaepro: celebrity endorsement + "active lifestyle." Moveit: clinical studies + pharmacist trust. Generic glucosamine: price/accessibility. | Knowing their angles tells you two things: where the market is crowded (don't compete head-on) and where there are gaps you can own. If everyone is doing "active lifestyle," maybe the opening is "daily pain relief for people who AREN'T athletes." |
| **Our unfair advantage over each** | vs. Vitaepro: Ingredient specificity (UC-II vs. generic collagen). vs. Moveit: Direct-to-consumer pricing, no pharmacy markup. vs. Generic glucosamine: Next-generation ingredients, glucosamine is outdated science. | This is ammunition for product-aware and most-aware stages. When someone already knows solutions exist, your job is to explain why THIS solution is better. You need these differentiators written down so every piece of creative can draw from them. |

---

### 1.3 — Customer Language Bank

| Field | FlexRepair Example | Why This Matters |
|---|---|---|
| **Verbatim phrases from reviews/comments (positive)** | "I can finally go up stairs without holding the railing." / "Woke up and my knees didn't crack for the first time in years." / "I was skeptical but after 3 weeks I noticed real change." | This is the single most valuable copy resource you have. Real customer language bypasses the "ad voice" that makes people scroll past. When someone reads "I can finally go up stairs without holding the railing" — that's not a marketer talking, that's a person they relate to. Record every powerful phrase you find. |
| **Verbatim phrases from reviews/comments (negative/skeptical)** | "Took it for a week, felt nothing." / "Too expensive for a supplement." / "How is this different from regular collagen?" | Objections are angles in disguise. "Took it for a week, felt nothing" tells you there's a timing expectation problem — which means you need ads that set expectations ("most people notice change in weeks 2-3, here's why"). Every objection is a hook waiting to be written. |
| **Where these customers spend time online** | Facebook groups: "Leddplager og gikt" (joint pain/arthritis), health forums like KK.no and Kvinneguiden. YouTube: searching "leddplager tilskudd" (joint pain supplements), "kne smerter øvelser" (knee pain exercises). Comment sections on Vitaepro ads. | This tells you where to find MORE language, but more importantly it tells you the CONTEXT your ads will appear in. If your audience is scrolling Facebook groups about joint pain, your ad needs to feel like a post in that group — not a polished brand ad. Knowing their digital habitat shapes your creative format and tone. |

---

---

## PHASE 2: RESEARCH

**Purpose:** Gather the raw intelligence that will feed your strategy map. Research has three pillars, done in this order.

**Why this order matters:** Current ads first (fastest wins), competitors second (market awareness), audience third (deepest but slowest). If you're launching a brand-new product with no ad history, skip to Pillar 2.

---

### Pillar 1: Current Ad Performance Audit

> *Skip this if the product has never been advertised.*

| Field | FlexRepair Example | Why This Matters |
|---|---|---|
| **Top 3 performing ads (last 90 days)** | 1) UGC testimonial — woman, 55, knee pain, video format. CPA: 520 NOK. 2) Static image — "Still taking glucosamine?" comparison angle. CPA: 580 NOK. 3) Before/after daily routine — man, 60, morning stiffness story. CPA: 610 NOK. | This is your baseline. Before you create anything new, you need to know what's already working. These ads tell you which personas, angles, and formats Meta's algorithm has validated with real spend. Your first batch of new creative should iterate on these, not ignore them. |
| **Top 3 worst performers (last 90 days)** | 1) Ingredient explainer carousel — CPA: 1,400 NOK. 2) Doctor endorsement video — CPA: 1,200 NOK. 3) Generic "joint health" static — CPA: 950 NOK. | Equally important. These tell you what the audience has REJECTED. The ingredient explainer bombing doesn't mean ingredients don't matter — it means the FORMAT (carousel) or the APPROACH (educational lecture) didn't work. Understanding *why* something failed is more instructive than knowing what succeeded. |
| **Patterns observed** | UGC outperforms polished. Story-based outperforms educational. Women 50+ respond best. Pain-focused hooks beat prevention-focused. Norwegian language outperforms English 3:1. | This is your meta-intelligence. Individual ad performance is noisy — but patterns across ads reveal structural truths about your audience. "Pain-focused hooks beat prevention-focused" is a strategic insight that should inform every angle you write going forward. |
| **Format gaps** | No short-form video (<15s) tested. No comment-style ads tested. No "listicle" format tested. | The gap analysis is where quick wins live. If UGC video works but you've never tried a short-form version, that's an obvious test. The strategy map should deliberately fill these gaps. |

---

### Pillar 2: Competitor Intelligence

| Field | FlexRepair Example | Why This Matters |
|---|---|---|
| **Competitor ad library audit (what are they testing THIS month?)** | Vitaepro: Heavy on athlete testimonials + "feel young again" messaging. New format: split-screen comparison videos. Moveit: Running clinical study angle + pharmacist recommendation UGC. New: TikTok-style fast cuts. | Competitors are spending money to test angles for you. If Vitaepro suddenly shifts to comparison videos, that format is either working for them or they believe in the trend. Either way, it's intelligence. Track this monthly — not as a one-time exercise. |
| **Angles they're NOT using** | Nobody is running a "glucosamine is outdated" disruption angle. Nobody is addressing the "I tried everything and nothing works" exhaustion persona. No competitor is using price comparison angles (D2C vs. pharmacy markup). | These are your blue ocean opportunities. The absence of an angle in the competitive landscape doesn't mean it won't work — it often means nobody has tried it yet. These gaps become your highest-priority test angles. |
| **Landing page / funnel differences** | Vitaepro uses long-form advertorial → checkout. Moveit drives to pharmacy locator. Neither competitor runs a VSL (video sales letter) funnel. | The ad is only half the equation. If all competitors use advertorials, a VSL could be a structural advantage. Or if advertorials are proven to work in the category, you should have one too. This data informs not just creative but the full funnel strategy. |

---

### Pillar 3: Audience Deep Dive

| Field | FlexRepair Example | Why This Matters |
|---|---|---|
| **Primary pain points (in their words)** | "I'm only 50 and I feel like I'm 80." / "I had to stop hiking because of my knees." / "I've tried glucosamine, fish oil, turmeric — nothing helps." | These are your hooks. Not the polished marketing version — the RAW emotional version. "I had to stop hiking because of my knees" is a better opening line than anything a copywriter invents from scratch. |
| **Emotional drivers behind the pain** | Fear of losing independence. Frustration with aging. Embarrassment about needing help with basic tasks. Missing activities they love. | Pain points describe WHAT hurts. Emotional drivers describe WHY they care enough to buy. A supplement doesn't sell — the promise of hiking again sells. The promise of not needing help getting out of a chair sells. These drivers differentiate good copy from great copy. |
| **Content consumption patterns** | Long Facebook reads (articles, testimonials). Health-focused YouTube (but not fitness influencers — more "health after 50" content). Morning newspaper-style browsing. Low TikTok usage in core demo. | This dictates your format strategy. If your audience reads long Facebook posts, your ad should feel like a long Facebook post — not a 6-second TikTok clip. If they watch "health after 50" YouTube, a 3-minute UGC story video will hold their attention. Matching format to consumption habit is critical. |
| **Trust triggers** | Skeptical of supplements (burned before). Trust: Norwegian-made, specific ingredients they can Google, real people's stories, "not another miracle cure" framing. Distrust: celebrity endorsements, exaggerated claims, English-language content. | This shapes your TONE. If the audience distrusts celebrity endorsements, using one is actively harmful. If they trust "real people's stories," UGC is your primary format. Trust triggers should be baked into every creative decision. |

---

### Phase 2 Output: Research Summary

Before moving to Phase 3, write a one-paragraph summary of your key findings. This forces synthesis.

> **FlexRepair Research Summary (Example):**
> Our strongest current creative uses UGC from women 50+ telling pain-to-relief stories, with CPAs around 520-610 NOK. The market is dominated by "active lifestyle" and clinical messaging — nobody is running a disruption angle against outdated supplements like glucosamine. Our audience is deeply skeptical of supplement claims, has likely tried and failed with other products, and consumes long-form content on Facebook. The biggest emotional driver isn't pain itself — it's the fear of losing independence and having to give up activities they love. Our angle priority should be: 1) "Everything else failed, here's why this is different" (disruption), 2) "Get back to the life you're missing" (emotional reclaim), 3) Specific mechanism education (UC-II vs. old science) delivered through relatable UGC, not clinical lecturing.

**Why the summary matters:** It prevents the strategy map from becoming a mechanical fill-in-the-blank exercise. The summary forces you to form a POINT OF VIEW about what will work — and that point of view guides every decision in Phase 3.

---

---

## PHASE 3: STRATEGY MAP

**Purpose:** This is the central artifact. It translates research into a structured creative plan by mapping **Personas × Angles × Awareness Levels**, then layering on **Format** and **Actor/Creator** assignments.

**Why this is the heart of the system:** Without this map, creative production is random. With it, every ad you produce fills a specific cell in a matrix — and you can see gaps, redundancies, and opportunities at a glance.

---

### Step 1: Define Personas (minimum 3)

Each persona represents a distinct *type of person* who would buy FlexRepair, with different motivations, language, and objections.

| Field | Persona 1 | Persona 2 | Persona 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Persona name** | The Active Retiree | The Worn-Out Worker | The Skeptical Supplement Veteran |
| **Age range** | 60-75 | 45-60 | 50-65 |
| **Gender skew** | Slight female skew | Balanced | Balanced |
| **Core situation** | Used to be very active (hiking, skiing, gardening). Joint pain is forcing them to stop activities that define their identity. | Physically demanding or sedentary desk job. Knees, back, hands hurt by end of day. Pushes through but quality of life is declining. | Has tried glucosamine, fish oil, turmeric, collagen powders — maybe 3-5 products over years. Nothing worked. Close to giving up on supplements entirely. |
| **Primary emotional driver** | Fear of losing independence and identity as an "active person." | Frustration — "I'm too young to feel this old." | Deep skepticism mixed with quiet hope — "I doubt this works but what if it does." |
| **Key objection to overcome** | "I'm already taking something from the pharmacy." | "I don't have time to research another supplement." | "How is this different from everything else I've tried?" |

**Why 3+ personas:** A single persona leads to a single angle, which leads to creative fatigue within weeks. Three personas give you three fundamentally different entry points into the market. When one persona's creative fatigues, you have two others scaling. This is how you achieve the creative diversity that Meta's algorithm (post-Andromeda) rewards.

**Why document the emotional driver and key objection:** These two fields do more work than anything else in the system. The emotional driver becomes your hook's *resonance target* — it's what makes someone stop scrolling. The key objection becomes the *structural challenge* your ad must solve. An ad that triggers emotion but doesn't handle the objection loses the sale. An ad that handles the objection but doesn't trigger emotion never gets watched.

---

### Step 2: Assign Angles per Persona

Each persona gets 1-3 angles. An angle is the *strategic argument* your ad makes — not the headline, but the underlying thesis.

| Persona | Angle 1 | Angle 2 | Angle 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| **The Active Retiree** | **"Get your life back"** — You didn't stop loving hiking; your joints stopped letting you. FlexRepair gives you back the activities that make you YOU. | **"Your pharmacy supplement is outdated"** — Glucosamine was 1990s science. UC-II collagen targets the actual cause of joint stiffness. Time to upgrade. | **"The 3-week test"** — Give FlexRepair 21 days. If you don't feel the difference in your morning stiffness, you'll know. Low risk, specific timeframe. |
| **The Worn-Out Worker** | **"You're not old, you're inflamed"** — Your joint pain isn't aging. It's chronic low-grade inflammation from years of wear. And it's fixable. | **"End-of-day pain is not normal"** — You've normalized knee pain at 50. But it's a signal, not a sentence. Here's what your joints are actually asking for. | — |
| **The Skeptical Veteran** | **"Why everything else failed"** — Glucosamine, fish oil, turmeric — they target symptoms. UC-II targets the immune response attacking your cartilage. Different mechanism, different result. | **"The one I almost didn't try"** — Testimonial-driven. Someone who was as skeptical as you, tried FlexRepair as a last resort, and got results they didn't expect. | — |

**Why document the angle as a thesis, not a headline:** Headlines change. Formats change. But the underlying *argument* stays stable across dozens of creative variations. "Your pharmacy supplement is outdated" can become a UGC video, a static image, a comment-style ad, a long-form post, or a VSL section — the angle stays the same. This is how you get creative volume without losing strategic coherence.

**Why some personas have 2 angles and others have 3:** Not every persona needs the same depth. The Active Retiree is likely your largest addressable segment and can sustain more angles. The Skeptical Veteran is narrower — two strong angles are enough. Forcing three angles on a thin persona leads to weak creative.

---

### Step 3: Awareness-Level Hook Matrix

For each persona × angle combination, write hooks at every awareness level. This is where the strategy map from your reference images lives.

**Below is one fully worked example: Persona 1 (Active Retiree) × Angle 1 ("Get your life back").**

| Awareness Level | Hook / Opening Line | Why This Level Needs Different Copy |
|---|---|---|
| **Unaware** | "The real reason your joints hurt more in the morning has nothing to do with aging." | At this stage, the person doesn't know they have a solvable problem. The hook must create curiosity about something they've accepted as inevitable. You're not selling — you're interrupting a belief. |
| **Problem Aware** | "If you've stopped doing the things you love because of stiff, aching joints — it's not your age. It's inflammation." | They know something's wrong but haven't looked for solutions. The hook must validate their experience ("stopped doing things you love") and reframe the cause (inflammation, not aging). This bridges them from "I have a problem" to "there might be a solution." |
| **Solution Aware** | "Joint supplements have been around for decades. But most of them target the wrong thing — here's what actually works for joint inflammation." | They know supplements exist. Your hook must differentiate the CATEGORY of solution (UC-II vs. traditional), not the product yet. You're positioning a class of solution, not a brand. |
| **Product Aware** | "FlexRepair uses UC-II collagen — the only form shown to target the immune response that breaks down cartilage. It's not like the collagen in your grocery store." | They know FlexRepair exists. Now you need to give them the REASON it works differently. Specificity matters here — ingredient names, mechanisms, differentiators. This is where your competitive positioning from Phase 1 pays off. |
| **Most Aware** | "Still thinking about FlexRepair? Your first month is 599 kr. Most people feel the difference by week 3." | They've seen your ads, visited your page, maybe added to cart. The hook is a nudge — specific price, specific timeline, remove the last friction. No storytelling needed. Just a clear, low-pressure CTA. |

**Why you need hooks at every awareness level:** Meta's broad targeting means your ad will be shown to people across ALL awareness levels. If you only write problem-aware hooks, you'll convert the middle of the funnel but miss the huge unaware audience AND leave money on the table with people who already know your product. Each level requires fundamentally different copy because the reader's starting mental state is different.

> **IMPORTANT: Repeat this matrix for every persona × angle combination.** For FlexRepair with 3 personas and 7 total angles, that's 7 matrices × 5 awareness levels = **35 distinct hooks minimum.** This is the creative volume that drives results.

---

### Step 4: Format Assignment per Awareness Level

Not every format works at every awareness level. This matrix ensures you match format to the psychological task of each stage.

| Awareness Level | Recommended Formats | Why These Formats |
|---|---|---|
| **Unaware** | Short-form UGC video (15-30s), "Did you know" static, comment-style ad, curiosity-driven Reel | The job is to STOP THE SCROLL with curiosity. Short, native-feeling formats that don't look like ads. The person doesn't know they need you yet — you need to earn 3 seconds of attention before anything else. |
| **Problem Aware** | UGC story video (30-60s), long-form Facebook post, "myth vs. reality" static carousel | The job is IDENTIFICATION. The person needs to see themselves in your content. Longer formats work because they're already emotionally engaged with the problem — they'll watch/read if it resonates. |
| **Solution Aware** | Explainer UGC (60-90s), side-by-side comparison static, ingredient breakdown video, advertorial link | The job is EDUCATION. You're teaching them why your category of solution works. This justifies longer, more detailed formats. The advertorial funnel shines here — they'll click through and read. |
| **Product Aware** | Testimonial UGC (60-90s), product demo, "unboxing + 30-day experience" video, review compilation | The job is PROOF. They need to see real people confirming the product works. Social proof formats dominate. The more specific and real the testimonial, the better. |
| **Most Aware** | Retargeting static with price/offer, short reminder video (10-15s), urgency-driven static, abandoned cart email style | The job is CONVERSION. Minimal creative, maximal clarity. Price, offer, CTA. They already know and want the product — just remove the last objection or create the final nudge. |

**Why format assignment matters:** A 90-second explainer video shown to an unaware audience will be skipped in 2 seconds — wasted production budget. A "Did you know" curiosity hook shown to a product-aware audience will feel too basic — wasted impression. Format-to-awareness matching is how you maximize the ROI of every creative asset you produce.

---

### Step 5: Actor / Content Creator Assignment

| Persona | Ideal Creator Profile | Why This Match |
|---|---|---|
| **The Active Retiree** | Woman, 60+, looks healthy but relatable (not a fitness model). Ideally Norwegian-speaking. Bonus: can film outdoors (garden, hiking trail, kitchen). | The audience needs to see THEMSELVES. A 25-year-old fitness influencer talking about joint pain has zero credibility with a 65-year-old woman. Matching the creator's age, gender, and vibe to the persona is what makes UGC feel authentic instead of performed. |
| **The Worn-Out Worker** | Man or woman, late 40s-50s. Relatable "everyday" look. Filmed in home or office setting. | Same principle — relatability. This persona is grinding through work with pain. They need to see someone who looks like a coworker, not a spokesperson. |
| **The Skeptical Veteran** | Someone who genuinely looks and sounds skeptical. Not overly enthusiastic. "I wasn't sure about this but..." energy. Slightly older, 55+. | This persona's defining trait is distrust. An overly positive creator will trigger their BS detector immediately. The creator must match the persona's emotional starting point (doubt) and then take them on the journey to belief. |

**Why you document creator profiles BEFORE production:** Without this, you end up casting whoever is available. Then you wonder why a 30-year-old's testimonial about joint pain converts at 1,400 NOK CPA. The persona-to-creator match is one of the highest-leverage decisions in the entire system.

---

---

## PHASE 4: PRODUCTION BRIEF

**Purpose:** Translate the strategy map into actionable instructions for designers, video editors, and content creators.

**Why this is a separate phase:** The strategy map tells you WHAT to make. The production brief tells you HOW to make it — in enough detail that someone who wasn't in your head can execute it.

---

### Brief Template (fill one per creative batch)

| Field | FlexRepair Example (Batch 1) | Why This Field |
|---|---|---|
| **Batch name** | FlexRepair NO — Q1 2026 — Batch 1 (Quick Wins) | Naming convention matters when you have dozens of batches across products. Without it, your asset library becomes an unsearchable mess within 3 months. |
| **Persona(s) targeted** | Persona 1: Active Retiree | Keeps the brief focused. A brief targeting all 3 personas at once produces generic creative. |
| **Angle(s) to produce** | Angle 1: "Get your life back" + Angle 2: "Your pharmacy supplement is outdated" | Typically 1-2 angles per batch to maintain quality. |
| **Awareness levels to cover** | Unaware, Problem Aware, Solution Aware (skipping Product/Most for Batch 1 since we need TOF volume) | Explicitly stating which awareness levels prevents the default of only making bottom-funnel ads. |
| **Number of assets per angle × awareness** | 2 variations per cell = 2 angles × 3 awareness levels × 2 variations = 12 creative assets | This is your production volume target. Without it, teams over-produce for one cell and leave others empty. |
| **Formats specified** | Unaware: 2× short UGC video (15-20s), Problem Aware: 1× UGC story (45s) + 1× long-form FB post static, Solution Aware: 1× explainer UGC (60s) + 1× comparison static | Each asset has a specific format assigned from the Phase 3 format matrix. No ambiguity for the production team. |
| **Creator(s) assigned** | [Creator name] — Woman, 62, Norwegian-speaking, has filmed UGC before. Can film in home + outdoor settings. | Pre-approved creator that matches the persona profile from Step 5. |
| **Scripts / talking points** | [Attached as separate document — one script per video asset, using the hooks from the awareness matrix as opening lines.] | Scripts should START with the hook from your awareness matrix. The rest of the script follows the hook's promise. |
| **Deadline** | Assets delivered by [date]. First round of review by [date + 3 days]. | Without deadlines, production takes 3x longer than necessary. |

---

---

## PHASE 5: LAUNCH & LEARN

**Purpose:** Test the creative systematically and feed learnings back into the strategy map.

**Why this phase matters as much as the others:** Creating great ads is only half the job. The other half is structured testing, honest analysis, and UPDATING your system based on what the market tells you. Without this, the strategy map becomes a static document that decays in value.

---

### 5.1 — Test Structure

| Field | FlexRepair Example | Why This Field |
|---|---|---|
| **Testing budget per asset** | 500-1,000 NOK per creative (enough for 1,000+ impressions at current CPMs) | Too little budget = inconclusive data. Too much = wasting spend on a loser. Define the test budget BEFORE launch so you're not making emotional decisions mid-flight. |
| **Primary KPI** | CPA (target: under 650 NOK) | One primary metric. Not three. Having multiple "primary" KPIs leads to analysis paralysis and justifying bad creative ("the CPA is high but the CTR is great!"). |
| **Secondary KPIs** | Hook rate (target: >25% for video), CTR (target: >1.5% for static), Thumbstop ratio, LP conversion rate | Secondary KPIs are diagnostic — they tell you WHERE in the funnel a creative is breaking, not whether it's working overall. |
| **Kill criteria** | If CPA exceeds 900 NOK after 1,500 NOK spend → kill. If hook rate is below 15% after 500 impressions → kill. | Pre-set kill rules prevent the "let's give it one more day" trap. Emotional attachment to creative you produced is real — kill criteria remove emotion from the decision. |
| **Test duration** | 3-5 days per creative (minimum) before making a verdict. | Too short = statistical noise. Too long = wasting budget. The 3-5 day window balances data quality with speed. |

---

### 5.2 — Performance Log (updated weekly)

| Creative ID | Persona | Angle | Awareness Level | Format | Spend | CPA | Hook Rate | CTR | Status | Learnings |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| FR-01 | Active Retiree | Get your life back | Unaware | UGC 15s | 800 NOK | 540 NOK | 32% | — | ✅ SCALE | Strong hook. "Morning stiffness" framing resonates. |
| FR-02 | Active Retiree | Get your life back | Problem Aware | UGC 45s | 750 NOK | 780 NOK | 22% | — | ⚠️ ITERATE | Good story but loses people at 20s mark. Cut to 30s version. |
| FR-03 | Active Retiree | Pharmacy outdated | Unaware | Static | 600 NOK | 1,100 NOK | — | 0.9% | ❌ KILL | Disruption angle too aggressive for static format. Try as video. |

**Why the log includes Persona, Angle, AND Awareness Level:** Because a 1,100 NOK CPA doesn't just mean "bad ad." It means the disruption angle didn't work AS A STATIC at the UNAWARE level. Maybe it works as a video. Maybe it works at the solution-aware level. The log must be granular enough to diagnose WHAT failed, not just THAT it failed. This is the data that makes your strategy map smarter over time.

---

### 5.3 — Strategy Map Update Cycle

**Cadence:** Every 2 weeks, review the performance log and update the strategy map.

| Update Action | When to Do It | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Promote a new winning angle** | When 2+ creatives for the same angle achieve target CPA | "Get your life back" confirmed as top angle → brief more format variations. |
| **Kill a dead angle** | When 3+ creatives for the same angle fail across different formats | If "pharmacy outdated" fails as static, video, AND long-form → archive the angle and replace it. |
| **Add a new persona** | When existing 3 personas are fatiguing and CPA is rising across all angles | If no angle is working for any persona → research phase again. Likely need a new entry point into the market. |
| **Shift awareness-level focus** | When one awareness level is saturated (high frequency, rising CPA) | If unaware hooks are fatiguing → shift budget to problem-aware and solution-aware where the audience has been warmed up. |
| **Add a new format** | When an angle is strong but creative volume within it is limited | "Get your life back" is winning in UGC → test it as a comment-style ad, a podcast-clip style, a "day in the life" Reel. |

**Why the update cycle is critical:** The strategy map is a LIVING DOCUMENT. Without scheduled updates, it becomes a historical artifact within 4-6 weeks. The update cycle is what turns a one-time planning exercise into a compounding system — every dollar spent teaches you something, and that learning gets encoded back into the map.

> **The goal of this system is not to guarantee that every ad wins. It's to guarantee that every ad TEACHES YOU SOMETHING — and that the lesson gets captured, organized, and fed back into the next campaign.** Over 6-12 months, the product owner who follows this system will have a strategy map so rich with validated insights that creating winning ads becomes less about inspiration and more about informed execution.
