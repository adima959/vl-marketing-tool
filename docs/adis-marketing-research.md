Idea: 

Product: 
# One-line description
Forces you to articulate what this product IS in plain language. If you can't say it in one sentence, your ads will be confused too.

*EXAMPLE* Joint & mobility supplement for adults experiencing stiffness, pain, or reduced flexibility.
This is your product truth — the factual backbone of every claim you'll make. Without documenting this, copywriters default to vague benefit language ("feel better!") instead of specific mechanism-based hooks ("UC-II collagen rebuilds the cartilage cushion between your joints"). Specificity sells.


# Key active ingredients / mechanism

*EXAMPLE* UC-II collagen, Boswellia extract, Vitamin D3, Magnesium. Works by reducing joint inflammation and supporting cartilage regeneration.






#### COMPETITORS:

Top 3 direct competitors:
You need to know WHO you're being compared to in the customer's mind. Your angles will either position against these competitors or ignore them — but that should be a conscious choice, not an accident.
Their main messaging angles! (Knowing their angles tells you two things: where the market is crowded (don't compete head-on) and where there are gaps you can own. If everyone is doing "active lifestyle," maybe the opening is "daily pain relief for people who AREN'T athletes.")


*EXAMPLE* Collagen+ (Vitaepro line) 2) Moveit (Orkla) 3) Generic glucosamine products at Apotek1

# Our unfair advantage over each
This is ammunition for product-aware and most-aware stages. When someone already knows solutions exist, your job is to explain why THIS solution is better. You need these differentiators written down so every piece of creative can draw from them.

*EXAMPLE*  vs. Vitaepro: Ingredient specificity (UC-II vs. generic collagen). vs. Moveit: Direct-to-consumer pricing, no pharmacy markup. vs. Generic glucosamine: Next-generation ingredients, glucosamine is outdated science.









## Verbatim Phrases from Reviews/Comments (Positive)

**FlexRepair Example:**

> *"I can finally go up stairs without holding the railing."*
>
> *"Woke up and my knees didn't crack for the first time in years."*
>
> *"I was skeptical but after 3 weeks I noticed real change."*

**Why This Matters:**

This is the single most valuable copy resource you have. Real customer language bypasses the "ad voice" that makes people scroll past. When someone reads *"I can finally go up stairs without holding the railing"* — that's not a marketer talking, that's a person they relate to. Record every powerful phrase you find.

## Verbatim Phrases from Reviews/Comments (Negative/Skeptical)

**FlexRepair Example:**

> *"Took it for a week, felt nothing."*
>
> *"Too expensive for a supplement."*
>
> *"How is this different from regular collagen?"*

**Why This Matters:**

Objections are angles in disguise. *"Took it for a week, felt nothing"* tells you there's a timing expectation problem — which means you need ads that set expectations (*"most people notice change in weeks 2-3, here's why"*). Every objection is a hook waiting to be written.

## Where These Customers Spend Time Online

**FlexRepair Example:**

- **Facebook groups:** "Leddplager og gikt" (joint pain/arthritis)
- **Health forums:** KK.no and Kvinneguiden
- **YouTube:** Searching "leddplager tilskudd" (joint pain supplements), "kne smerter øvelser" (knee pain exercises)
- **Comment sections:** On Vitaepro ads

**Why This Matters:**

This tells you where to find MORE language, but more importantly it tells you the CONTEXT your ads will appear in. If your audience is scrolling Facebook groups about joint pain, your ad needs to feel like a post in that group — not a polished brand ad. Knowing their digital habitat shapes your creative format and tone.






PHASE 2: RESEARCH

Purpose: Gather the raw intelligence that will feed your strategy map. Research has three pillars, done in this order.
Why this order matters: Current ads first (fastest wins), competitors second (market awareness), audience third (deepest but slowest). If you're launching a brand-new product with no ad history, skip to Pillar 2.

## Pillar 1: Current Ad Performance Audit

# Top 3 performing ads (last 90 days)
This is your baseline. Before you create anything new, you need to know what's already working. These ads tell you which personas, angles, and formats Meta's algorithm has validated with real spend. Your first batch of new creative should iterate on these, not ignore them.


*EXAMPLE* 1) UGC testimonial — woman, 55, knee pain, video format. CPA: 520 NOK. 2) Static image — "Still taking glucosamine?" comparison angle. CPA: 580 NOK. 3) Before/after daily routine — man, 60, morning stiffness story. CPA: 610 NOK.


# Patterns observed
This is your meta-intelligence. Individual ad performance is noisy — but patterns across ads reveal structural truths about your audience. "Pain-focused hooks beat prevention-focused" is a strategic insight that should inform every angle you write going forward.

*EXAMPLE*: UGC outperforms polished. Story-based outperforms educational. Women 50+ respond best. Pain-focused hooks beat prevention-focused. Norwegian language outperforms English 3:1.
