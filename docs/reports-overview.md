Vitaliv Analytics — Reports Overview


How Reports Work

All reports share a common set of interactions.

Dimensions — Group your data hierarchically (e.g. Country → Product → Date). Add multiple dimensions to create drill-down levels.

Date Range — Filter data to a specific time window.

Expand Rows — Click a row to load and reveal the next dimension level beneath it.

Sort — Click any column header to sort ascending or descending.

Shareable URLs — Every filter, sort, and expanded row is saved in the URL. Copy it to share your exact view with a teammate.
